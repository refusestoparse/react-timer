# Stopwatch App

## Learning Targets

- **React State**: `useState` and `useEffect`
- **React Components**: Managing multiple instances independently
- **React Style Inheritance**
- **React Scope**
- **TypeScript Variables and Syntax**
- **`useState` with Arrays**

## Project Overview

As I was getting started with React, I found understanding state management a bit tricky. To tackle this, I decided to build a stopwatch app that updates every second. This project helped me see firsthand how React's state and effects work together in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time Stopwatch**: The app features a stopwatch that updates every second, which was a great way to get a grip on using `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Lap Functionality**: To dig deeper into state management, I added a lap feature. This lets users capture and display the stopwatch's time at different points, showing how to handle and preserve state effectively.

## Skills Gained

- **React State Management**: Hands-on experience with `useState` and `useEffect`, learning how to manage and update state.
- **Component Design**: Creating multiple instances of components that work independently without affecting each other.
- **React Styling**: Exploring how styling works in React and how to apply and manage styles across components.
- **React Scope**: Improved understanding of how state and props are handled within and between components.
- **TypeScript Basics**: Comfortable with TypeScript variables and syntax, and managing arrays with `useState`.

## Conclusion

Building this stopwatch app was a great learning experience. It helped me understand the core concepts of React, from state management to styling. Plus, I learned a lot about how HTML and CSS fit into React components, which was a bonus.
